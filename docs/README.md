Ensure Node.js is installed then start the web server with:

node ./server.js [port]
[port] is optional and defaults to 3000.

Load the demonstration home page at http://localhost:3000/#/Development_manual (or which ever port you specified). Recommendations:

Use Chrome or another Blink-based browser.
Open a new incognito tab/window. This will ensure nothing remains cached while you are testing.
Open the Developer Tools and View the Application tab.
Check Offline in the Service Workers section and browse to another page.
Connect an Android smartphone via USB and attempt remote debugging.
